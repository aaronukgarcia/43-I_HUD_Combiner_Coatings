# 43-I: Polymer Multilayer Coatings for Heads-Up Display Combiners

> **Part of [Project 43 — Labrador](https://github.com/aaronukgarcia): Exploring commercial and scientific applications of synthetic labradorescence**

## Overview

Proposes polymer multilayer films as narrowband reflective coatings for HUD and helmet-mounted display combiners. Three candidate architectures: BCP self-assembled, co-extruded, and laminated polymer films. Whether any can achieve HUD-grade spectral precision is the central open question.

## Status

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Stage | Technical/Engineering |
| Spectral precision demonstration | **Not yet achieved** |
| Prototype | None |
| Seeking | Polymer optics, HUD systems engineering, military qualification, roll-to-roll manufacturing |

## Key Idea

A HUD combiner reflects display light at specific wavelengths while transmitting ambient light — this is the general class of optical behaviour that structural-colour polymer films produce. Polymer films could offer conformability and roll-to-roll cost advantages over traditional vacuum-deposited inorganic coatings.

## Target Applications (Conditional)

- Automotive HUD
- Military helmet-mounted displays
- Augmented reality combiners
